# Cafe-API (Original)

SQLite + SQL Alchemy + JSON + Python + REST API(original) 

This is the original API I have created and published on Postman. 

This app uses SQLite as database which stores json data information about the cafes located around in London. 

You can see and use the working API here!: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10892873/TVmMgHTz
